The results of the Naive Gaussian Elimination method and the Gaussian 
Elimination with the Scaled Partial Pivoting method are identical. Although it is the same in this instance, 
I have tested in other systems and these two methods can yield results that differ by a small error. 
This variation may be caused by numerical errors that can happen during computations. 
Each element is divided by the pivot element in naive Gaussian elimination, which can result in accuracy loss and solution mistakes. 
By choosing the pivot element as the largest element in the column divided by the scaling factor for that row, 
Scaled Partial Pivoting attempts to reduce these inaccuracies. 
However, there are some cases showing that SPP can yield a result having a slight numerical error by a very small fraction,
 while the Naive Gaussian method gave a more accurate answer.
